# Assignment 2
## Programming and Analyzing Protocols with Packet Losses: Sliding Window with Packet Losses

In this Assignment the goal is to use the CNSS (and its provided simulation environment) to program and simulate protocols when packet losses can occur.
The objectove is to develop a file transfer with a slidingwindws protocol than can tolerate packet losses. 

The assignment and guidelines will be available soon.
