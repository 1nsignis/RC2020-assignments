# Assignment 3
## TCP and HTTP Programming using Sockets in Java

In this Assignment and its Guidelines we will learn how to use Sockets to program client/server applications using the Java Language. 
For the assignment the final goal is to implement a Client/Server application for File Transfer based on HTTP. In the developed application, 
clients can download files from several web-servers (supporting HTTP) used in parallel, in order to maximize the file transfer rate.

The assignment and guidelines will be available soon.
