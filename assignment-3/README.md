# Assignment 3: File Transfers in parallel using TCP and HTTP
**Note**: The assignment and guidelines below are not in its final version. Final version will be available soon.

## A robust client to download content from multiple HTTP servers

In this Assignment and its Guidelines you will learn how to program with Sockets to program client/server applications supported by TCP and how to program clients that can transfer contents from HTTTP servers. After the initial guidance, diivded into two parts, the final goal is to implement a Client/Server application for File Transfer based on HTTP, where clients can download files from several web-servers used in parallel, in order to maximize the file transfer rate. 
For the assignmemt the implementation of the web-servers are provided as initial material. the assignmemt consists in the developmet of the required client implementation.

### Assignment Motivation

In today's internet, most of the users consumed content is carried over the HTTP protocol. In the specific case of multimedia contents, the volume of the consumed information varies from a few Mbytes (in the case of photographs), up to several Gbytes (in the case of movies).
It is not realistic to think of such bulky objects being transferred in a single HTTP request/reply interaction and using a single TCP connection. 
Inevitably, due to the high volumes of data, momentary anomalies in the network, or problems in the servers, it is necessary to resort to more than one interaction among the client and the server(s). In addition, in the case of movies, as they can take hours to play, it is not mandatory or interesting to transfer in only one chunk the full content, or from the same server. Also, a faster download may be achieved if transferring in parallel from several servers, using different HTTP ranges.

### HTTP Protocol and How to Download Digital Objects from HTTP Servers
As you know, HTTP is supported by the TCP transport protocol, and it operates in two basic variants (HTTP/1.0 - implementaing HTTP Request/Response with non-persistet connections, and hTTP/1.1: using persistent connections). Clients that interact with HTTP servers must send correct HTTP requests (with the proper HEADERS), sent as formatted 
requests sent in the TCP connection previous estabished with the server. Clients must be able to receive HTTP responses, processing them according to the HTTP protocol (interpreting the HEADERS and CONTENTS in the RESPONSE).

For the operation of the HTTP protocol you must consider the explanation in the theoretical classes. 
- You can also study the HTTP protocol in the course textbook: **https://legatheaux.eu/book/cnfbook-pub.pdf, see chapter 12**, paying special attention to HTTP requests/responses using RANGE REQUESTS.

## PART I - Networking Programming using TCP Sockets in Java

Summary
- Client/Server Model with TCP
- TCP Sockets
- Java Example
- Exercise: File Transfer over TCP

### Client/Server Model
A Client/Server Application has two base autonomous components that can run as processes in the same Host or distributed in two different internetworked Hosts:
- Server: the first to run - usually always running and ready to process requests from the client
- Client: usually started by the user, to request a service from the server

### Client/Server Model with TCP Channels

The following figure represents the typical interaction between a client and server.

XXXXXXXXXXX PICTURE XXXXXXXXXXX

### TCP Logical Channels or Connections (or Streams)
- A TCP connection is a logical two-way reliable channel among two processess
- The connection is open by the client, directed towards the server IP address and port,
- The server IP address and port identifies the other extreme of the connection
- It supports two independent, reliable and ordered flow of bytes â€” one in each direction
- It can be closed at any moment by any of the two communicating processess
- Before any communication can take place, both sides must agree that they want to establish the communicating TCP channel among them

### TCP Sockets
- A TCP connection is established among two TCP Sockets, one in each extreme of the channel
- A client TCP Socket "opens" a connection to the server side TCP Socket - the first opens the connection, the second one accepts it
- A server creates a TCP Socket to accept incoming connections; this socket has a server port and the server IP address
- A client opens or creates the connection by requesting the creation of a local TCP Socket connected to the server TCP Socket

### Example (ECHO Server and Client)
In this simple example the client creates a TCP Socket by connectiong it to the server TCP Socket; the server Socket is identified by the server address and the socket port. Then, the client reads lines from its console and sends them to the server. The server reads the bytes sent by the client and echoes them back to the client. 

### Java Server Code
The code of the server (**EchoServer.java**) is very simple. It just creates a Socket to accept incoming connections in the previously agreed port. Then it accepts client request to establish a connection.
```
import java.io.* ;
import java.net.* ;

public class EchoServer {

   public static final int DEFAULT_PORT = 8000 ;
	
   public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {

       int port=DEFAULT_PORT;
       if (args.length == 1) {
	   port=Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
       }
       
       System.out.println("Server waiting in port " + port);
       // creates a server socket to wayt for connections
       try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket( port )) {
	   for(;;) { 
	             Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept() ;
		     System.out.println("Got a client connection from "
			+ clientSocket.getInetAddress().getHostName());

		     // handling the client connection
		     new ConnectionHandler().handle( clientSocket );
		   }
       } catch (IOException x) {
	   x.printStackTrace();
       }
   }
}
```

When the connection is established, the handler simply continously reads bytes and writes them back to the other side while the connection is not closed.
```
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class ConnectionHandler {
    private static final int TMP_BUF_SIZE = 1024;

    public void handle(Socket cs) throws IOException {

	InputStream is = cs.getInputStream();
	OutputStream os = cs.getOutputStream();

	for(;;) { 
        // implements the data ECHO, by reading and writing 
        // while the connection is not closed
	    int n ;
	    byte[] buf = new byte[TMP_BUF_SIZE] ;
	    while( (n = is.read(buf)) > 0 )
		os.write( buf, 0, n );
	}
    }
}

```
    


### Java Client

The client starts by processing the parameters and opening a connection to the server.
When the connection is open, it starts using it as a read / write stream/pipe.
As you can see (EchoClient) Once the connection is established, the client prepares a Scanner to read bytes from the console (System.in).
Enters a loop where it reads a line, sends it to the server, gets the echo and prints it to the console, until it receives the string "!end". 

```
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.*;

public class EchoClient {

    public static void main(String[] args ) throws Exception {
		
    if( args.length != 2 ) {
      System.out.println("usage: java EchoClient <serverhost> <serverport>");
      System.exit(0) ;
    }
    
    String server = args[0] ;
    int port = Integer.parseInt(args[1]) ;
		
    Socket socket = new Socket( server, port ) ;
    OutputStream os = socket.getOutputStream();
    InputStream is = socket.getInputStream() ;

    Scanner in = new Scanner( System.in ) ;
    byte[] buf;
    int n;
    String echoRequest;
    
	do {
	    echoRequest = in.nextLine();
	    echoRequest = echoRequest + "\n";

    	    System.out.println("I will send: " +echoRequest);
            os.write( echoRequest.getBytes() );

	    String echoReply = new Scanner(is).nextLine();
            System.out.println("Reply form Server: " +echoReply);

      	   } while( !echoRequest.equals("!quit\n") ) ;

           socket.close() ;
    }
}


```

### Some Recipes

### Class ServerSocket
```
try( ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket( PORT ) ) {
    ...
        cs = ss.accept();
    ...
}
```

### Class Socket
```
try( Socket ss = new Socket( server, PORT ) ) {
    ...
    InputStream is = ss.getInputStream();
    OutpoutStream os = ss.getOutputStream();
    ...
}
```

### Sending and receiving (multiple) bytes
```
int n;
byte buf = new byte[TMP_BUF_SIZE];
while( (n = is.read( buf )) > 0 )
    os.write( buf, 0, n)
```    
    
### Reading a single byte at each time (slow)
```
InputStream is = cs.getInputStream();
int b = is.read();
```

### WARNING: Anti-Pattern
```
InputStream.available() works with FileInputStream, but does not work with streams that are backed by Sockets.

Socket cs = new Socket( server, port );
InputStream is = cs.getInputStream();
while( is.available() ) {  
};
```

### About Threads 

Threads can be programmed with different options: Lambda Expressions or use of Helper Classes.

### Threads + Lambda Expression

```
new Thread( () -> {
    
    // place here code to execute in new thread...
    
}).start();

```


### Threads + Helper class

```
Helper class implements interface Runnable

Main thread calls:

new Thread( new HelperClass( args )).start();

Child thread executes in run(), receives args in constructor...

  class HelperClass implements Runnable {
    HelperClass( ... ) {
        // Constructor receives any args the helper class needs to run...
    }
    public void run() {
       // place here code to execute in new thread...
    }
}

```
Helper class extends Thread
Cannot be used if helper class already extends another class...

Main thread calls:
new HelperClass( args ).start();


Child thread executes in run(), receives args in constructor...

```
class HelperClass extends Thread {
    HelperClass( ... ) {
        // Constructor receives any args the helper class needs to run...
    }
    public void run() {
       // place here code to execute in new thread...
    }
}
```

### The Multithreaded EchoServer 
This server uses threads to implement concurrency. As you can check the server can handle different clients in parrallel.

```
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class ConcurrentEchoServer {
    
    public static final int DEFAULT_PORT = 8000 ;
    public static void main( String[] args )throws Exception {

	int port=DEFAULT_PORT;
	if (args.length == 1) {
	    port=Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
	}
        System.out.println("Server waiting in port " + port);

	try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket( port )) {

	    Socket clientSocket;
	    ServiceHandler servthread;

	    while(true) {
		clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
		servthread = new ServiceHandler(clientSocket);
		servthread.start();
	    }
	}
	catch (IOException x) {
	    x.printStackTrace();
	}
    }
}

```

As you can see in the COncurret EchoServer, the connections from clients are served through the thread **servthread**.
The ServiceHandler class as an Helper class is below. As you can see it uses again the initial **ConnectonHandler** above,
but now the client connections are handled in parrallel.

```
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

class ServiceHandler extends Thread {
    Socket connection;
	
    public ServiceHandler(Socket c) {
	super("EchoServer service thread");
	connection = c;
    }
    
    public void run()  {
         // handling the client connection                          
	try {
	    new ConnectionHandler().handle(connection);
	}
	catch (IOException x)
	    {
		x.printStackTrace();
	    }
    }
}

```


## PART II - Using the HTTP Protocol to Download Digital Objects from a Server


### To be Inluded ASAP




### Assignment 3

To complete this assignment you must program an HTTP client that must be able to transfer a voluminous file (e.g. above 100 Mbytes) from a set of HTTP "tricky" servers, in the shortest time. These "tricky" servers, whenever they receive a request of an object, may only send part of the requested object or break the connection in the middle of the transfer. Also, each server can exhibit variable transfer performances. Servers accept ranges requests from clients.

The assignmet is composed by two developments for delivering: delivery 1 and delivery 2.
